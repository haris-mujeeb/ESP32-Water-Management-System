## Project Overview

The ESP32 Water Management System is designed to:
- Monitor water levels in two underground tanks and two upstairs supply tanks.
- Automatically fill the upstairs tanks when the water level is low.
- Provide real-time monitoring and control via a WiFi-based smart switch.

## Components Needed

- **ESP32 Development Board**
- **Water Level Sensors**
- **WiFi Smart Switch**
- **USB Power Adapter**

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/haris-mujeeb/ESP32-Water-Management-System.git
   cd ESP32-Water-Management-System
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**
- Install the necessary libraries in your Arduino IDE for the carbon sensor and WiFi connectivity.

3. **Connect the Hardware**
- Follow the wiring diagram provided in the repository to connect the ESP32 to the ultrasonic sensors and smart switch.

4. **Configure WiFi Credentials**
- Open the `main.cpp` file and update the `ssid` and `password` variables with your WiFi credentials.

5. **Upload the Code**
- Upload the code to the ESP32 using the Arduino IDE.

## Usage

- Once the system is powered on, it will start monitoring the water levels in the tanks.
- The smart switch will be activated automatically to fill the upstairs tank when the water level is low.
- You can monitor the system status through the Smart Life app.
